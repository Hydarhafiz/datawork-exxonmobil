# Welcome to ExxonMobil DataWorks Challenge

## About the challenge
Topic: Classification Model for Well Slugging

Submission: 4th Nov 2022 (Friday) at 9.00am (GMT +8)

# Folders:
1. Common - essential code that can be shared between all .ipynb files
2. Dataset - source of dataset for this project
3. ModelArchive - location to store the best model


# Files:
1. `analytic_workbook.ipynb` - to put all related analytics results 
2. `model_testing_workbook.ipynb` - to put best model testing results
3. `model_training_workbook.ipynb` - to put model training results
4. `Data Definitions.xlsx` - definitions about the data


# DataSet:
1. `complete_well_data.csv` - both training and testing data, suitable for analytics
2. `test_well_data.csv`     - test data, suitable for machine learning
3. `train_well_data.csv`    - training data, suitable for machine learning


# Recommended Library to be installed for workbook  
1. `pip install pandas`
2. `pip install seaborn`


# NOTE:
1. Teams can focus on either data exploration and/or machine learning modeling using their own tools and not limited to the folders/files here. 
2. Teams are required to clean their own code and ensure readability before submission.
3. Please put related files and create a manual on 
   1. How the results/findings is obtained 
   2. Tools used 
   3. Special instruction needed to run your project
   4. Etc
4. Slugging Class is defined by the following pseudocode where `fluctuationTreshold` is a tunable parameter
```
if (the value of "WHP Fluctuation (%)") <= fluctuationTreshold: 
    then, SluggingClass = 'Non-Slugging'
else,
     SluggingClass = 'Slugging'
```
7. In `Preprocessing.py` there is a function `getSluggingClass(df, WHPFluctuationTreshold)`, the `WHPFluctuationTreshold` is a tunable parameter that should be optimised by the teams.
8. The column `"WHP Fluctuation (%)"` should not be used for the training or testing because it is used to derive the Slugging Class.
9. Please put your final `WHPFluctuationTreshold` inside `Common/Config.py` and your manual. 
10. Do not clear your workbook results.


# Submission:
1. 7 minutes video (.mp4) about your findings and/or modeling
2. Documentation (.pdf) on the following
    1. Setup instruction, 
    2. Development process, 
    3. Findings/visualization
3. Machine Learning model file (if any)
4. Provide any file that is used for development, analytics and testing for this challenge
